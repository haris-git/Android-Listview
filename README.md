# Android Form Application with two activities

Example of a functional app that demonstrates a **"listview"** for future reference. I have created a listeview that contains all the days of a week. Whenever the user click on the name of a day, it appears in a textview, on top of the screen.

You can see how the app looks like after opening the preview.png
